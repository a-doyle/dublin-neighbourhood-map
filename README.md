This is a page powered by JavaScript to use data from the Google Maps API.

Making use of the various supports offered by the Google Maps API, this page offers a fictional listing of real estate in the South Dublin Area.

Canonically named, these locations are initially hidden, but allow for visibility as the user selects the option to show or re-hide the listings.

The use of the drawing tool allows users to draw on an area of the map and view homes located in the designated area, only if there are any of course.

The page also offers the user of selecting homes within a certain time period (up to an hour) from a given location, via a user-directed mode of transport. This allows the user to view an optimized route to take to reach the selected destination.

Entering your favourite area, or any area for that matters, allows the user to center the map on that location. 

Following these, the page allows the user the user to search for utilities offered, as shown by the placeholder. The icons appear as the user hits Go, and the map centers on a location to allow for all utilities to be shown to the user at once.

The input boxes all make use of autocomplete, giving the user an option to select something based on their input without finishing said input.

As the user clicks an icon, an infobox pops up, giving information about the locatiom, drawn from the Google Maps API.

Will be looking at expanding to include more information and more search filters, so feedback is more than welcome.
